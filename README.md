# MLAlgorithmsFromScratch

This is a repository to store basic ML algorithms written from scratch.
I used this to explore some of the ML algos taught in greater detail (such as the mathematics)
instead of relying solely on the pre-existing python libraries. 

Algorithms covered: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. 

## To view
See the ipynb files.
